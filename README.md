# rgpluaclassbrowser
Class browser for RGP Lua Finale plugin.

RGP Lua Class Browser is a modeless dialog box implemented in Lua. It is designed to run in the [RGP Lua](https://robertgpatterson.com/-fininfo/-rgplua/rgplua.html) plugin environment within the [Finale application](https://www.finalemusic.com/) for music notation.

As a modeless dialog, the minimum version of RGP Lua it can run under is v0.56. It is also dependent on `jwluatagfile.xml` for method and property type information as well as links to the [PDK Framework documentation](https://robertgpatterson.com/-fininfo/-rgplua/pdkframework/index.html). Both the currently released  `rpgluaclassbrowser.lua` and `jwluatagfile.xml` are available at the [download site](https://robertgpatterson.com/-fininfo/-rgplua/rgplua.html) for RGP Lua.

The `jwluatagfile.xml` file should be placed in the same folder as `rgpluaclassbrowser.lua`.

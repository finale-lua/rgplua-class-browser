# RGP Lua Class Browser
Class browser for the RGP Lua Finale plugin.

RGP Lua Class Browser is a modeless dialog box implemented in  the [Lua Programming Language](http://www.lua.org/). It is designed to run in the [RGP Lua](https://robertgpatterson.com/-fininfo/-rgplua/rgplua.html) plugin environment within the [Finale application](https://www.finalemusic.com/) for music notation.

As a modeless dialog, the minimum version of RGP Lua required is v0.56. It is also dependent on `jwluatagfile.xml` for method and property type information as well as links to the [PDK Framework documentation](https://robertgpatterson.com/-fininfo/-rgplua/pdkframework/index.html). The `jwluatagfile.xml` file is auto-generated by [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl) with changes tracked in this repository. The current release of both  `rpgluaclassbrowser.lua` and `jwluatagfile.xml` are available at the [download site](https://robertgpatterson.com/-fininfo/-rgplua/rgplua.html) for RGP Lua.

The `jwluatagfile.xml` file and the `xml2lua` subfolder should be placed inside the same folder as `rgpluaclassbrowser.lua`. A simple way to get started with it is to download the repository to any folder on your computer, along with the `xml2lua` submodule, and point RGP Lua to the `rgpluaclassbrowser.lua` script. After restarting Finale it appears in your RGP Lua menu.
